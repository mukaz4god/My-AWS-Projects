**✅ Senior-Level Answer (Use This)**
I treated the AWS account setup as a security hardening engagement.
On day one, I implemented an AWS security baseline aligned with the AWS Well-Architected Security Pillar and CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark.

I locked down the root account with MFA and eliminated day-to-day root usage by enforcing IAM-based administration.
I enabled centralized logging with CloudTrail across all regions to ensure full auditability, and I implemented AWS Budgets with alert thresholds to prevent cost-related incidents.

The outcome was a production-ready AWS account with identity protection, audit logging, and financial guardrails in place before any workloads were deployed.

**💡 STAR Method Version (Behavioural Interviews)**

**Situation**
A fintech startup (KFJ Solutions) was migrating to AWS without a defined cloud security baseline.

**Task**

My responsibility was to secure the AWS account from day one and prevent security or financial incidents.

**Action**

I enforced root account protection using MFA, moved all operational access to IAM users, enabled CloudTrail across all regions for audit logging, and implemented AWS Budgets with alerts to control spend.

**Result**

The AWS account met security best practices before hosting any workloads, with strong identity controls, full visibility, and cost governance in place.
